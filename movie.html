          “Don’t ever let somebody tell you you can’t do something. Not even me. You got a dream, you gotta protect it. When people can’t do something themselves, they wanna tell you you can’t do it. You want something, go get it. Period.”

        <p>
          "The Pursuit of Happyness" is an emotionally powerful film that genuinely moved me. Will Smith’s performance as Chris Gardner feels real, raw, and deeply inspiring. The story shows the reality of struggle in pursuit of dreams, and the sacrifices that come with it. It’s not just about success—it's about what it takes to earn it.

        <h2>What I Learned from the Movie</h2>
        <p>
          This movie reinforced the idea that success doesn’t come easy—it’s about perseverance, belief, and resilience. Chris Gardner’s journey taught me the value of staying committed to one’s dreams even when the odds are against you. It’s a reminder that we must keep pushing, even when no one else believes in us.
